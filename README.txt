Thanks for using my makefile generator!

Prerequisites:
	1. Ensure you have Python 3.4+ installed.

Usage:
	1. You can run the generator by either:
		a. Running directly with Python:
			i. 		Opening a console window within the directory containing the generator.
			ii.		Running "python makegen.py"
		b. Changing the permissions of the file with chmod:
			i.		Opening a console window within the directory containing the generator.
			ii.		Running "chmod a+x makegen.py"
			iii.	Running "./makegen.py"
	2. The generator does not HAVE to be in the directory with your files.
		a. Using the automated file input feature (selecting 1 in the first option) requires you
			to be in the same directory as your .c and .h files.
		b. Using the manual file input feature (selecting 2 in the first option) requires you to
			run the program with the .c and .h files as arguments, but does not require you to have
			any files in the same directory as the makefile generator.
